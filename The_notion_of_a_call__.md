The notion of a call stack is a dynamic one that would be normally be seen in an execution trace even though this analysis is static. The information needed to complete the analysis meaningfully can be derived from a call graph. A call graph can be used to determine which functions can possibly be called from any function. That determination is used to derive any recursion as well as the necessary contexts that will be needed when solving for \(A'\) so breaking pledges are not made.
