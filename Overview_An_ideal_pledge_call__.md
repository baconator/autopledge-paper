##Overview

An ideal pledge call is inserted at exactly the points in a program where static analysis has concluded the keywords it lists are the minimal set necessary for future operation. A conceptual overview of the algorithm which computes these points is given in section 3, however, the handling of recursion and looping constructs have not been handled.

Cycles, whether at the function or basic block level, are a concern. A valid analysis must ensure that the possibility of executing a code segment multiple times is taken into account, however, since reasoning about such behaviour would necessitate a form of symbolic execution, the authors propose a method of precision loss instead. Function and basic block summaries are computed such that all code segments in a cycle are considered to make the same set of system calls. This is implemented by representing the calling elements as nodes in a graph, where every node contains a bitvector of possible system calls. Then, for every node, the bitvector of the caller and their own are met and assigned to the caller's node. Since the bitvector and meet operator over bitvectors forms a lattice, application of this algorithm may be shown to a reach a fixpoint in maximally quadratic time in node cardinality.
