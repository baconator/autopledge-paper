##Motivation

System and high performance computing code are often written in low level languages such as C and C++. Low level languages provide high performance but are open to memory corruption attacks due to lack memory safety and manual memory management. Memory corruption attacks \cite{Szekeres_2013} starts by creating memory errors such as overflows,underflows or dangling pointers. One main type of memory corruption attack is control-flow hijacking that takes control of the entire program by using memory errors to enable the write and execution of desired instructions. The classic control-flow attack that works by overwriting the program with new instructions can prevented with non-executable data policies, however Jump Oriented Programming (JOP) can bypass data policies by chaining in-memory code from common libraries such as libc. There are enough instruction sequences and system calls in libc functions that make it Turing complete \cite{Tran_2011}, allowing attackers to create arbitrary programs.
