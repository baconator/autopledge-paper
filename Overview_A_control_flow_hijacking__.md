##Overview

    A control-flow hijacking attack is considered successful when malicious code begins executing. A meaningful attack often requires the execution of system calls \cite{Szekeres_2013}. Pledges can be added to mitigate the effectiveness of attacks through security vulnerabilities by reducing the available resources, types of system calls, to the attacker.
    Blah blah.
