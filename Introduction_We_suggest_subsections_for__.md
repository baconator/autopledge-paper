#Introduction
We suggest subsections for the Problem Statement, the Research Objectives, and the description of
the Context of the research. In particular the description of the context is an essential input for
aggregating studies

## Problem statement
The problem statement is important because it supports the readers in comparing their problems with
the problem investigated in the reported experiment. In addition, this section helps to judge the
relevance of the research. In general, we would expect answers to the questions: What is the
problem? Where does it occur? Who has observed it? Why is it important to be solved? Any
underlying theory, causal model, or logical model has to be specified in this section. The problem
statement should end with a brief description of the solution idea and the (expected) benefits of this
solution. 

## Research objective
With regard to the research objective, or, as Wohlin et al. called it, the “Definition of the
Experiment”, the description should follow the goal template of the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM)
method [24]:

> Analyze <Object(s) of study> for the purpose of <purpose> with respect to their <Quality Focus>
> from the point of view of the <Perspective> in the context of <context>.
> For examples of the use of the goal definition template, see [34] or [25]. The common use of this
> formalized format would increase the comparability of research objectives, e.g., for the purpose of
> systematic reviews. 

## Context
Similar to the CONSORT Statement [1], our Context subsection suggests that the setting and
locations of a study are described. The author should provide information that will help the readers
understand whether the research relates to their specific situations. After having executed the
experiment, the context is needed to evaluate external validity, i.e., transferability of results from one
context to another. The context consists of all particular factors that might affect the generality and
utility of the conclusions, like:
* application type (e.g., real-time system),
* application domain, (e.g., telecommunication),
* type of company (e.g., small and medium sized),
* experience of the participants (e.g., professionals with on average five years of related practical
experience),
* time constraints (e.g., critical milestones, delivery date ) ,
* process (e.g., spiral model),
* tools (e.g., used for capturing requirements),
* size of project (e.g., 500 person months)
Furthermore, it has to be mentioned if there are specific requirements with regard to the support
environment. It is sufficient to describe the context factors informally.
