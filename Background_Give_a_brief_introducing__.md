Background: Give a brief introducing notice about the motivation for conducting the study.

Example: “Software developers have a plethora of development technologies from which to choose,
but often little guidance for making the decision”.

Objective: Describe the aim of the study, including the object under examination, the focus, and the
perspective. Example: “We examined <technique1> vs. <technique2> with regard to fault detection
rates from the viewpoint of a quality engineer”.

Method: Describe which research method was used to examine the object (e.g., experimental design,
number and kind of participants, selection criteria, data collection and analysis procedures).

Example: “We conducted a controlled experiment using a 2x2 factorial design with 24 randomly
assigned undergraduate students participating. The data were collected with the help of
questionnaires and analyzed using ANOVA”.

Results: Describe the main findings. Example: “<technique1> was significantly more effective than
<technique2> at an alpha level of 0.05”.

Limitations: Describe the major limitations of the research, if any. Example: “Generalization of
results is limited since the analyzed technique was applied only to specify systems smaller than
10.000 lines of code”.

Conclusion: Describe the impact of the results. Example: “The result reinforced existing evidence
regarding the superiority of <technique1> over <technique2>”. Furthermore, to address
practitioners’ information need regarding cost, benefits, risks, and transition issues shall be
described.
