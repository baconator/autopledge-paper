To determine where pledge calls can be inserted into the program shown in Figure 1, knowledge of function _f_ calling function _g_, _f_ calling system call 1, and both functions calling system call 2 is required. That knowledge would allow the determination that a pledge on system call 2 can only occur at the end of the second basic block in _f_ instead of after _g_ is called. To make that determination, two sets can be used to represent which system calls have executed so far and which system calls have yet to execute for each function, _A_ and _A'_ respectively. In order to form _A_ and _A'_ for a function _f_ with a call to another function _g_, all system calls in _g_ will have to be known which will be called _G_.
