##Setup

Some form of call graph must be generated, as this analysis hinges upon interprocedural information. This is provided by CIL in the form of a callgraph module implemented as an extension. Another data structure to encode system call information for every code segment, derived by the algorithm defined in section 3 in addition to the addendums made in the overview for section 4, is generated by visiting all functions and blocks, as necessary, in the analyzed program.
