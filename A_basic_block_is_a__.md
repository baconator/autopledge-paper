A basic block is a sequence of code with no branches in or out except from the entry and exit. It follows that there is no way to enter or jump from anywhere inside a basic block and all instructions inside the basic block execute only once and in order. Basic blocks can then be seen as the largest unit of code which preserves control flow for an analysis. Basic blocks make up functions and will therefore be denoted by $f_0$
