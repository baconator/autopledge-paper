Smartphones have large amounts of personal information such as sensor data, photos, and contacts. To protect user privacy and safety, granular application permissions are an essential part of mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. Developers are likely to over permission their applications as a study \cite{Felt_2011} found that about one-third of all Android applications are over-permissioned. Vidas and his colleges created a static analysis tool \cite{vidas_christin_cranor} to help developers find the least amount of permissions. In contrast to Android permissioning, pledge allows for additional pledging anywhere in the code, further reducing the attack surface. We take advantage of this and add pledges to different parts of the program.
